# tui-timer

there are a *ton* of terminal based clocks out there, and i had no clue which was the best one,
so i made my own. Its *intended* to be easy to use, simple, and customizable.

# current progress

currently its just missing some polish, maybe a digital function and time left being printed

# how to compile and run
just type in make in terminal and an excecutable should pop out

excecute tui-timer after compiling, its in the directory

eg:
```
make
./tui-timer
```

# dependancies

ncurses, make and to be on linux
